## DrawSense ADHD — Digital Screening Support Tools for clinicians

Proud to share our Design Thinking Project, DrawSense ADHD, a digital screening support tool designed to assist clinicians in observing ADHD behaviors in a more engaging and low-pressure way. DrawSense ADHD uses simple behavioral questions and drawing tasks to help clinicians observe attention, impulsivity, and executive functioning in a more natural setting. This project was developed with empathy and user needs in mind, combining technology and healthcare ethics. While DrawSense ADHD is not a diagnostic tool, it aims to support clinicians by providing structured and standardized insights to aid screening decisions. 

Throughout this project, we learned the importance of empathy, user-centered design, and collaboration when developing digital solutions for healthcare. The process helped us understand real-world challenges faced by clinicians and the ADHD community, while also strengthening our problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork skills. This experience showed us how technology can create meaningful impact when it is designed with real user needs in mind. 

Sincere appreciation to my amazing teammates, Chia Jie Ling, Thiviya Krishnan, and Afif Azfar, for their dedication and contribution of valuable ideas, effort, and skills throughout every stage of the design thinking process.
